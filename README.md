# Garuda Ace Research Information Hub

This repository is used to maintain and log all our experiment.

## Repository Description

The Garuda Ace Research repository is a repository to research and reach a conclusion of how much we can get from existing parallel data, comparing approaches such as Unsupervised vs Supervised,
Pretrained vs From Scratch Training, Codeswitch vs No Codeswitching. It was created to create a baseline based on available data for Regional Languages in Indonesia. 
To achieve our goal, we modify research that has been done by other researcher. Those modified repositories will be found in the same GitHub Organization.
